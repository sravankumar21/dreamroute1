        },
        {
          "question": "What is a switch in networking?",
          "answer": "A switch is a network device that connects devices within a LAN and uses MAC addresses to forward data to the appropriate destination. It operates at the Data Link layer of the OSI model."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is a packet in networking?",
          "answer": "A packet is a small unit of data transmitted over a network. It contains the payload (actual data) and metadata (such as source and destination IP addresses, and protocol information)."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is bandwidth?",
          "answer": "Bandwidth refers to the maximum rate at which data can be transmitted over a network connection or communication channel. It is usually measured in bits per second (bps)."
        },
    {
      "question": "What is the difference between a switch and a hub?",
      "answer": "A switch operates at the Data Link layer and forwards data based on MAC addresses, sending it only to the intended recipient. A hub operates at the Physical layer and broadcasts data to all connected devices, regardless of the recipient."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the purpose of the ARP protocol?",
      "answer": "ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) is used to map an IP address to a MAC address within a local network. It enables devices to locate each other on the same network segment."

    {
      "question": "What is the role of the Network Layer in the OSI model?",
      "answer": "The Network Layer (Layer 3) is responsible for routing data packets from the source to the destination across multiple networks. It handles logical addressing (e.g., IP addresses) and packet forwarding."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a VPN?",

    {
      "question": "What is an IP address?",
      "answer": "An IP (Internet Protocol) address is a unique numerical label assigned to each device connected to a network that uses IP for communication. It identifies devices and facilitates their interaction over the network."

    },
    {
      "question": "What is a port number?",
      "answer": "A port number is a numerical identifier in a network protocol used to specify a particular process or service on a device. It allows multiple services to run simultaneously on a single IP address."

    {
      "question": "What is a DMZ (Demilitarized Zone) in network security?",
      "answer": "A DMZ (Demilitarized Zone) is a network segment that acts as a buffer zone between an internal network and external networks (like the Internet). It hosts services that need to be accessible from outside, such as web servers, while protecting the internal network."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a network protocol?",
